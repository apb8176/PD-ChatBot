    "answer": "Based on the available sources, here are some options to report emissions:\n\n1. Apply emission factors and Global Warming Potential (GWP) rates consistently for the data disclosed [Consolidated Set of the GRI Standards-563.pdf].\n2. Use GWP rates from the IPCC assessment reports based on a 100-year timeframe [Consolidated Set of the GRI Standards-563.pdf].\n3. If subject to different standards and methodologies, describe the approach to selecting them [Consolidated Set of the GRI Standards-563.pdf].\n4. List other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions, with a breakdown by upstream and downstream categories and activities [Consolidated Set of the GRI Standards-563.pdf].\n5. Provide a breakdown of other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions by business unit or facility, country, type of source, and type of activity, where it aids transparency or comparability over time [Consolidated Set of the GRI Standards-563.pdf].\n\nAdditionally, the NGER Methods and measurement criteria guideline mentions that reporters have the provision to select methods for the estimation of emissions. Reporters can use different methods for different fuels, individual gases, and even for separate instances or occurrences of a source [NGER Methods and measurement criteria guideline-5.pdf].\n\nPlease note that these recommendations are based on the available sources, and it is important to refer to specific reporting guidelines applicable to your organization or industry for more detailed information.",

It is intended that the reporter indicate the method used for reporting each source. For example, the reporter can apply different methods for different fuels and different methods for individual gases. Where appropriate, the reporter can use different methods to estimate emissions from ‘separate instances of a source’ (section 1.9A of the NGER Measurement Determination) and ‘separate occurrences of a source’ (section 1.9B of the NGER Measurement Determination).

This guideline is intended to promote better reporting by assisting: • landfill operators to estimate and report emissions from solid waste management at landfills • landfill biogas managers to estimate and report their emissions • landfill operators and landfill biogas managers to estimate and report energy production and energy consumption. It may also be useful for auditors and other users or preparers of NGER data and reporting from landfill operations and landfill biogas management. The guideline outlines the general principles and rules concerning how to measure and estimate emissions from different waste streams, waste mix types and climatic conditions, and how to distinguish between legacy and non-legacy waste.
